# shufflr
Shufflr is a Python script that reblogs all posts from one blog to another. The posts can be sorted randomly, by the number of likes, or a combination of the two. The combo splits the  the top 20%, the next 30%, and the last 50% of posts based on likes into tiers and randomizes them.

# How to start
* Download Python 2.7.3 (3~3.5.1 should work as well)
* Download the [pytumblr module](https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr)
* Fill in the variables in `config.txt` and rename it to `config.py`
* Type `python main.py`
* Enjoy!
